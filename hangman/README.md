# hangman

**Description**: Chapter 13 asks the reader to follow along with a simple hangman project. It revisits this project down the road so I figured it deserved its own folder. In the book it uses the dictionary found in your operating system but for this upload I used a comparable dictionary from: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt. The license was automatically generated by following the project initialization instructions in the book.

**Building**: To get this up and running as described in the book, ensure you have Stack installed and issue the following commands: 
1. `stack init`
2. `stack build`
3. `stack exec -- hangman`
